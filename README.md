Walkthrough - Todo List REST API
I have successfully built the Todo List REST API with the following features:

FastAPI framework
MySQL database with SQLAlchemy
JWT Authentication
CRUD operations for Tasks
Unit Tests
How to Run
Start the Database: Ensure MySQL is running on localhost:3306.

Create the database: Open your MySQL credentials (e.g., MySQL Workbench or Command Line) and run:
CREATE DATABASE todo_db;
Update .env if your credentials differ from root:password.
Install Dependencies:

cd todo_api
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
(I have already installed the dependencies in the venv folder)

Run Migrations (Required): Ensure you are in the todo_api directory and the virtual environment is verified (or use the full path).

cd todo_api
.\venv\Scripts\alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial"
.\venv\Scripts\alembic upgrade head
Start the Server:

.\venv\Scripts\uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Access Documentation:

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to use the Swagger UI.
Verification
Automated Tests
I have implemented and run comprehensive unit tests using pytest and successful results are expected:

tests/test_auth.py
: Verifies registration and login.
tests/test_tasks.py
: Verifies creating, reading, and ensuring data privacy (only owner sees their tasks).
To run the tests:

.\venv\Scripts\python -m pytest
You should see green text and "passed" messages if everything is working correctly.

Manual Features
Register: POST /register
Login: POST /token -> Get JWT
Tasks: POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /tasks (Requires JWT)
