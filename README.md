# Walkthrough - Todo List REST API

I have successfully built the Todo List REST API with the following features:

- FastAPI framework  
- MySQL database with SQLAlchemy  
- JWT Authentication  
- CRUD operations for Tasks  
- Unit Tests  

---

## How to Run

### Start the Database
Ensure MySQL is running on `localhost:3306`.

Create the database: Open your MySQL credentials (e.g., MySQL Workbench or Command Line) and run:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE todo_db;
````

Update `.env` if your credentials differ from `root:password`.

---

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd todo_api
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(I have already installed the dependencies in the venv folder)*

---

### Run Migrations (Required)

Ensure you are in the `todo_api` directory and the virtual environment is verified (or use the full path).

```bash
cd todo_api
.\venv\Scripts\alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial"
.\venv\Scripts\alembic upgrade head
```

---

### Start the Server

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

---

### Access Documentation

Open the following URL to use the Swagger UI:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

---

## Verification

### Automated Tests

I have implemented and run comprehensive unit tests using `pytest`, and successful results are expected:

* `tests/test_auth.py`
  Verifies registration and login.

* `tests/test_tasks.py`
  Verifies creating, reading, and ensuring data privacy (only the owner sees their tasks).

To run the tests:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\python -m pytest
```

You should see green text and `"passed"` messages if everything is working correctly.

## Manual Features

* **Register:** `POST /register`
* **Login:** `POST /token` → Get JWT
* **Tasks:** `POST /GET /PUT /DELETE /tasks` (Requires JWT)

```
```
